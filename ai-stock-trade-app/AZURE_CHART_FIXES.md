# Azure Deployment Fix for Chart Functionality

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. CSS 404 Error
**Problem**: `ai_stock_trade_app.styles.css` was referenced but not deployed to Azure  
**Solution**: Removed the reference to the auto-generated CSS file from `_Layout.cshtml`

```diff
- <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/ai_stock_trade_app.styles.css" asp-append-version="true" />
```

### 2. JavaScript Duplicate Declaration Error
**Problem**: `StockTracker` class was being declared multiple times  
**Root Cause**: `stock-tracker.js` was loaded twice - once in `_Layout.cshtml` and once in `Dashboard.cshtml`  
**Solution**: Removed duplicate script reference from `Dashboard.cshtml`

```diff
- <script src="~/js/stock-tracker.js"></script>
```

### 3. Chart.js Error Handling
**Problem**: Charts might fail to load on Azure due to CDN or timing issues  
**Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling:

- Check for Chart.js availability before initializing charts
- Graceful fallback when Chart.js is not loaded
- Display fallback text when chart creation fails

## Files Modified

### `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`
- Removed problematic CSS reference
- Kept Chart.js CDN and single script reference

### `Views/Stock/Dashboard.cshtml`
- Removed duplicate script reference
- Kept only the configuration script

### `wwwroot/js/stock-tracker.js`
- Added Chart.js availability checks
- Added error handling for chart creation
- Added fallback display for failed charts

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Ensure old cached files are not causing conflicts
2. **Check Network Tab**: Verify all resources are loading successfully
3. **Console Monitoring**: Watch for any remaining JavaScript errors

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to Azure:
1. These fixes should resolve the 404 CSS error
2. JavaScript duplication error should be eliminated
3. Charts should either display properly or show appropriate fallback

## Error Prevention

The enhanced error handling now includes:
- Chart.js library detection
- Graceful degradation when charts can't be created
- Console logging for debugging
- Visual fallback indicators

## Expected Behavior

- **With Chart.js loaded**: Charts display normally with historical data
- **Without Chart.js**: Fallback text "ðŸ“ˆ Chart unavailable" appears
- **No JavaScript errors**: Clean console output even if charts fail

These fixes should resolve the Azure deployment issues while maintaining local functionality.
